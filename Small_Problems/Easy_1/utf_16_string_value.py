Write a function that determines and returns the UTF-16 string value

use ord to determine the UTF-16 value of a character.)

"""CODE EXPLAINATION
On line 9, the function utf16_value is defined with a single parameter
named string. When this function is called with a string argument, the
sum built-in function is called on a list comprehension. The list
comprehension loops through each character in string, and uses the ord
built-in function to return the UTF-16 value for the character, and
append this value to the resulting list. When the loop has finished, the
final list is passed to the sum function, and resulting sum is returned.
